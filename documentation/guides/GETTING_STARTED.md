# Getting Started: Running the Casbin DB Project

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the Casbin DB project for the first time, including bootstrapping the database with necessary initial data.

---

## 🚀 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Go**: Version 1.25.5 or higher.
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**: Essential for running the database (MySQL) and cache (Redis) services.
- **Make**: The `Makefile` simplifies common development tasks.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Air** (Optional but Recommended for Development): For live-reloading the application during development.
  ```bash
  go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
  ```
- **Swag CLI** (Optional): For regenerating API documentation if you make changes to Swagger annotations.
  ```bash
  go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
  ```
- **Golang Migrate** (Optional): If you want to run migrations manually without the Makefile helper.
  ```bash
  go install -tags 'mysql' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest
  ```
- **C/C++ Compiler (GCC/MinGW-w64)**: Required for running repository tests that use SQLite (due to CGO). Ensure `gcc` is in your system's PATH.

## ⚙️ 2. Setup & First Run

### Step 2.2: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file from the example and configure your application settings.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

**New Feature Configuration:**

- **Storage**: By default, `local` is used. Files are stored in `./uploads`.
- **Telemetry**: To enable tracing, set `OTEL_ENABLED=true` and ensure Jaeger is running.

### Step 2.3: Start Infrastructure Services

Use Docker Compose to launch the MySQL, Redis, and Jaeger containers.

```bash
# Using Makefile helper
make docker-dev

# OR directly
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d
```

### Step 2.4: Run Database Migrations

Apply the database schema migrations. This will create tables and the very basic default roles (`role:user`, `role:admin`).

```bash
make migrate-up
```

### Step 2.5: Seed Initial Data

After migrations, you can seed more comprehensive initial data, such as a `role:superadmin` and a default super admin user, along with initial Casbin policies.

```bash
make seed-up
```

### Step 2.6: Run the Application

Now that the database and Redis are ready, you can start the Go application.

**For Development (with Live Reload):**

```bash
air
```

- This command will compile and run your application, automatically restarting it whenever code changes are detected.

**Standard Run (without Live Reload):**

```bash
go run cmd/api/main.go
```

The application will typically start on `http://localhost:8080` (check your `.env` or console output for the exact port).

## ✅ 3. Verification

Once the application is running, you can verify the setup:

- **Access Swagger UI**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/api/docs/index.html`. You should see the interactive API documentation.
- **Test with Postman**:
  1.  Import the Postman collection `postman/Casbin_API_Full_Flow.postman_collection.json` into Postman.
  2.  Set up your Postman environment variables (`baseURL` to `http://localhost:8080`, `apiVersion` to `v1`).
  3.  Run the collection. All requests should execute successfully, demonstrating user registration, login, role assignment, and RBAC checks.

You are now ready to develop and extend the Casbin DB project!
