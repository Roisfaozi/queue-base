# Getting Started: Running the Casbin DB Project

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the Casbin DB project for the first time, including bootstrapping the database with necessary initial data.

---

## 🚀 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Go**: Version 1.25.5 or higher.
- **Docker** & **Docker Compose**: Essential for running the database (MySQL) and cache (Redis) services.
- **Make**: The `Makefile` simplifies common development tasks.
- **Git**: For cloning the repository.
- **Air** (Optional but Recommended for Development): For live-reloading the application during development.
  ```bash
  go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
  ```
- **Swag CLI** (Optional): For regenerating API documentation if you make changes to Swagger annotations.
  ```bash
  go install github.com/swaggo/swag/cmd/swag@latest
  ```
- **Golang Migrate** (Optional): If you want to run migrations manually without the Makefile helper.
  ```bash
  go install -tags 'mysql' github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate@latest
  ```
- **C/C++ Compiler (GCC/MinGW-w64)**: Required for running repository tests that use SQLite (due to CGO). Ensure `gcc` is in your system's PATH.

## ⚙️ 2. Setup & First Run

### Step 2.1: Configure Environment Variables

Create a local environment file from the example and configure your application settings.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

**New Feature Configuration:**

- **Storage**: By default, `local` is used. Files are stored in `./uploads`.
- **Telemetry**: To enable tracing, set `OTEL_ENABLED=true` and ensure Jaeger is running.

### Step 2.2: Worktree-Based Development Flow

For parallel development from `dev`, use git worktrees.

Recommended branch promotion path:

- `main` → production-ready
- `staging` → release candidate
- `dev` → daily integration branch

Create a feature worktree from `dev`:

```bash
make wt-new feat/my-feature
```

If current checked out branch is `dev`, that worktree is based on `dev` automatically. If you need another base branch, pass second positional arg explicitly, for example `make wt-new feat/my-feature staging`.

By default, worktrees are created under `.worktrees/` inside this repo so the flow still works in restricted environments. If your machine allows sibling folders and you prefer them, override `WORKTREE_ROOT` explicitly.

This command now auto-creates and bootstraps worktree-local `.env.local`.

Then enter that worktree and start local stack:

```bash
cd .worktrees/feat-my-feature
make dev-up
```

If `.env.example` changes later and you only want to append missing keys into your local file:

```bash
make env-sync
```

For more detailed parallel stream guidance, read:

- `documentation/guides/WORKTREE_FLOW.md`

To ensure env for an existing worktree and print its path:

```bash
make wt-enter feat/my-feature
```

### Step 2.3: Start Infrastructure Services

Use Docker Compose to launch the MySQL, Redis, and Jaeger containers.

```bash
# Recommended worktree-local flow
make dev-up

# Legacy alias still supported
make docker-dev

# OR directly
# docker compose --env-file .env.local -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

### Step 2.4: Run Database Migrations

Apply the database schema migrations. This will create tables and the very basic default roles (`role:user`, `role:admin`).

```bash
# Recommended worktree-local migration
make migrate-up-local

# Legacy global migration helper still exists
# make migrate-up
```

### Step 2.5: Seed Initial Data

After migrations, you can seed more comprehensive initial data, such as a `role:superadmin` and a default super admin user, along with initial Casbin policies.

```bash
make seed-up
```

### Step 2.6: Run the Application

**For Development (with Live Reload):**

```bash
air
```

- This command will compile and run your application, automatically restarting it whenever code changes are detected.

**Standard Run (without Live Reload):**

```bash
make run
```

**Inspect Worktree Dev Stack:**

```bash
make dev-status
make doctor
```

The application will typically start on the port defined by `.env.local` or `.env` (check your local env file and console output for the exact port).

---

## ✅ 3. Verification

Once the application is running, you can verify the setup:

- **Inspect environment readiness**:
  ```bash
  make doctor
  ```
- **Inspect current worktree stack**:
  ```bash
  make dev-status
  ```
- **Run narrow local tests**:
  ```bash
  make test-local
  ```
- **Access Swagger UI**: Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:<APP_PORT>/api/docs/index.html`. You should see the interactive API documentation.
- **Test with Postman**:
  1. Import the Postman collection `postman/Casbin_API_Full_Flow.postman_collection.json` into Postman.
  2. Set up your Postman environment variables (`baseURL` to `http://localhost:<APP_PORT>`, `apiVersion` to `v1`).
  3. Run the collection. All requests should execute successfully, demonstrating user registration, login, role assignment, and RBAC checks.

You are now ready to develop and extend the Casbin DB project.
